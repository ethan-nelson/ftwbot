# ftwbot

This is a bot for use in [Discord](http://www.discordapp.com). It contains miscellaneous features, including a poker game.

It's heavily experimental and customized toward my use case. That said, if you are interested in using it, feel free to drop me a line and I can help. The main things that will need to be changed are environmental variables with login/access tokens, specific WOL links, and the Twitter account actually queried.
